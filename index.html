      <h1> Hi, I'm Kirthi! </h1> 
      <h2> I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying EECS + Business in the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.) Program.
        In my free time, I'm a lover of pasta, policy, and people. More on those later. </h2>

    <h3> I want to learn more about... </h3>
      <p> Food. While I love trying to cook and eating new food, pasta is my winner-takes-all (pizza -- white to be specific -- is a close second). Fun Fact: I've been vegetarian my whole life.</p>
      <p> Tech policy. Technology is great and all, but I think the greatest impact lies in using it for the people. Check out the Tech Talent Project where I helped with some awesome policy memos. </p>
      <p> Other humans. I love meeting new people and trying new things. Find me on instagram and facebook if you want to chat. </p>
      <p> Myself. I'm sort of obsessed with YouTube videos on self-optimization/productivity and trying to find new ways to promote self-reflection. </p>
      <p> Pens and cars. I'm a pen hoarder and a lover of MINIs and Teslas. </p>
      <p> Philosophy. Self-conciousness. Ethics. Astronomy. Political rhetoric. </p>
