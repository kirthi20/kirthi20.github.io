      <h1> Hi, I'm Kirthi! </h1> 
      <h2> I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying EECS + Business in the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.) Program.
        In my free time, I love to make pasta, read about politics, and meet new people. </h2>

      <h3> My interests include... </h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Technology (obviously)! Check out some of my experiences below... </li>
        <li> Operations and Sustainability. I'm currently taking my first business course (UGBA 10: Principles of Business) and I'm really looking forward to this unit!</li>
        <li> Tech policy. Technology is great and all, but I think the greatest impact lies in using it for the people. Check out the Tech Talent Project where I helped with some awesome tech transition policy memos! </li>
        <li> Food. Pasta is my favorite food in the whole world, but I love trying new foods! Fun fact: I've been a vegetarian my whole life. </li>
        <li> Improving myself. I'm sort of obsessed with YouTube videos on self-optimization/productivity and trying to find new ways to promote self-reflection. </li>
        <li> Pens and cars. I'm an unabashed pen hoarder and a lover of electric cars like Teslas and the new MINI electric. </li>
        <li> Other humans. I love meeting new, interesting people in new settings (now, new Zoom backgrounds). Find me on instagram and facebook if you want to chat! </li>
        <li> Female representation in tech! Started my non-profit, SheSoft, to build a sustainable network of girls interested in solving problems with tech. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4> Some academic topics of interests include: self-conciousness and ethics (in relation to ML/AI), political rhetoric, learning languages (was President of our Spanish National Honor Society club in high school) and astronomy (worked on a CubeSat back in high school)! </h4>
